# Voucher System Architecture

## Overview
The voucher system is a React-based implementation that manages digital vouchers for books, series, and collections. It uses Supabase for data persistence and real-time updates.

## Core Components

### VoucherManagement
- Main container component
- Handles voucher listing and CRUD operations
- Implements pagination and filtering

### VoucherList
- Presentational component for displaying vouchers
- Handles sorting and filtering of vouchers
- Implements bulk actions

### VoucherForm
- Handles voucher creation and editing
- Implements validation using Zod
- Manages different voucher types

## Data Flow
1. User requests voucher data
2. Query is sent to Supabase
3. Data is cached using React Query
4. UI updates with new data
5. Changes trigger real-time updates

## Performance Monitoring
- Tracks operation durations
- Measures component render times
- Monitors API response times

## Error Handling
- Implements error boundaries
- Tracks and logs errors
- Provides user feedback

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for data flow
- Performance testing
- Error scenario testing

## Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Input validation
- Rate limiting

## Future Improvements
1. Implement batch operations
2. Add advanced filtering
3. Enhance performance monitoring
4. Expand test coverage
